## Summary: 
Based on our finding the 5 star paid review does not win the majority because there are none. Given that, there needs to be more paid reviews for books. But the average of unpaid reviews are 68%. Even when customers or not benefitting from the Vine program in getting paid to review they are still doing it with maybe other benefits of possibly getting free products.
